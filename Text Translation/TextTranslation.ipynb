    "In this final part, you are going to implement the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) Score to assess the effectiveness of translations as a ratio. Completely mismatched results will be scored as 0.0, and the perfect translation will be scored as 1.0. There are various formulas applied to sentence, corpus or any length translation, but it's meant to be a good proxy to compare various implementations. Our date translation examples are simple, but BLEU score is also meant to encapuslate how a human would rate the translation for language translations. \n",

    "\n",
    "As you have discovered, attention spreads the probability of which character to pay attention to in a given sequence. There are other strategies we can apply to improve the results of the translation. Beam search is one such heuristic that is popular. Beam search works by returning a list of output sequences that are most likely for a given input. It does this by exploring all of the possible next steps, and then chooses the most promising candidates from all possibilities. Those candidates form a 'beam' of directions, where the algorithm expands the search through each candidate's sequence of probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The larger the beam, the better the performance of the model. Since there are more candidate sequences, this means the likelihood of finding the right answer increases. However, it requires more decoding, meaning a direct tradeoff with the quality of results versus accuracy. Seeding beam search with the most likely next words in a sequence can yield good results. The beam search would generate the resulting sequence, starting from the first word and appending, while exploring all the candidates (size of the beam) every step of the way.\n",
